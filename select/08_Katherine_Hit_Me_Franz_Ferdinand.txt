Katherine, kiss me
Slip your little lips will split me
Split me away, your eye won't hit me
Yes, I love you, I mean, I
I'd love to get to know you

Sometimes I say the stupid things I think, I mean, I
Sometimes I think the stupidest things
And do you ever wonder how the boy feels?

Katherine, kiss me
Flick your cigarette then kiss me
Flick your eyes at mine so briefly
Your leather jacket lies in sticky pools of Cider Blackberry

You glance and ricochet
From every alpha male behind me
Eyes like bubbles on the washing machine
I wonder how the boy feels

Katherine, kiss me
In the alleyway by [Incomprehensible]
Jacket in the sodium light
Yes, I love you, I mean, I, I mean, I need to love

And though your opened eyes stay bored
Upon the overflowing pipes above me
Tonight I don't mind
Because I never wonder how the girl feels
