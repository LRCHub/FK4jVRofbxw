[00:19.48] Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
[00:23.63] That's OK, let's see how you do it
[00:27.17] Put up your dukes, let's get down to it
[00:31.03] Hit me with your best shot
[00:34.05] Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

[00:45.69] 
[00:45.90] You come on with the "come on"
[00:47.81] You don't fight fair, that's OK, see if I care
[00:53.52] Knock me down, it's all in vain
[00:57.12] I get right back up on my feet again
[01:01.10] Hit me with your best shot

[01:49.81] Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
[01:53.07] Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
[01:57.41] You better make sure you put me in my place
[02:01.42] Hit me with your best shot
[02:04.34] Come on! Hit me with your best shot
[02:08.74] Hit me with your best shot
[02:11.51] Fire away
[02:16.35] Hit me with your best shot
[02:19.38] Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
[02:23.83] Hit me with your best shot
