He hit me
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
But it didn't hurt me

He couldn't stand to hear me say
That I had been with someone new
And when I told him I had been untrue

He hit me
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
And I knew he loved me

If he didn't care for me
I could have never made him mad
But he hit me
And I was glad

He hit me
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
And I knew I loved him

And when he took me in his arms
With all the tenderness there is
And when he kissed me
He made me his
